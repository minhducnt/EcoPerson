# EcoPerson Project

## Team Members

## Overview

The EcoPerson project addresses serious environmental issues in Hồ Chí Minh City, particularly water pollution caused by illegal discharges into rivers and a lack of environmental awareness among local residents. This initiative employs IoT devices installed in rivers, alongside AWS services, to measure and monitor water quality changes. When unusual changes in water quality are detected, the system automatically sends notifications to app users within a specific radius, helping residents stay informed and take timely actions to reduce pollution. By doing so, EcoPerson contributes to raising environmental awareness and encouraging the community to protect clean water sources.
